# todo-list

A JavaScript + HTML program which literally makes a To-Do List. 

To-Do. Hmmm.
I gotta do this today.
I got to do this today.
I got to-do this today. GOTCHA!

This is a simple program made in VS Code using HTML, CSS and JS. I also used Live Server (https://bit.ly/3w2voSD) to test it. This has a to-do list which you can organise and change as your wish.

Happy to-doing!
(wait... is to-do a verb or a noun? eh, no worries, i have nothing "to do" with it now ;) )
